# Mailjet sample for Google App Engine

**Java 7 runtime support on App Engine standard was [deprecated](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/deprecations/java7) on
December 13, 2017 and will be shut down entirely on January 16, 2019. It is replaced by the
[Java 8 Runtime Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/runtime-java8).**

Samples for the Java 8 runtime can be found [here](/appengine-java8).

This sample demonstrates how to use [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) on Google Managed VMs to
send emails from a verified sender you own.

## Setup
1. Before using, ensure the address you plan to send from has been verified in Mailjet.

## Running locally
    $ export MAILJET_API_KEY=[your mailjet api key]
    $ export MAILJET_SECRET_KEY=[your mailjet secret key]
    $ mvn clean appengine:devserver

## Deploying
1. Edit the environment variables in the appengine-web.xml with the appropriate Mailjet values.
    $ mvn clean appengine:update

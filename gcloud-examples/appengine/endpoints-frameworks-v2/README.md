# Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine Standard

**Java 7 runtime support on App Engine standard was [deprecated](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/deprecations/java7) on
December 13, 2017 and will be shut down entirely on January 16, 2019. It is replaced by the
[Java 8 Runtime Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/runtime-java8).**

Samples for the Java 8 runtime can be found [here](/appengine-java8).

This directory contains Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine for
App Engine Standard samples. The [`backend/`](backend/) directory contains the
sample code for the [quickstart][4] for Cloud Endpoints Frameworks on App Engine
using an OpenAPI development process. The [`migration-example/`](migration-example/) directory
contains the sample code for a [migrated][2] version of the [Cloud Endpoints
Frameworks][1] sample project to the new [Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine][8]
development process.

The new Google Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for App Engine provides
[additional functionality][3] using OpenAPI which may require payment.
It's recommended that you migrate projects using the prior version of [Cloud Endpoints Frameworks][1].

App Engine Java Guestbook

**Java 7 runtime support on App Engine standard was [deprecated](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/deprecations/java7) on
December 13, 2017 and will be shut down entirely on January 16, 2019. It is replaced by the
[Java 8 Runtime Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/runtime-java8).**

## Sample guestbook for use with App Engine Java.

Requires [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) 3.1 or greater, and JDK 7+ in order to run.

To build, run

    mvn package

Building will run the tests, but to explicitly run tests you can use the test target

    mvn test

To start the app, use the [App Engine Maven Plugin](http://code.google.com/p/appengine-maven-plugin/) that is already included in this demo.  Just run the command.

    mvn appengine:devserver

For further information, consult the [Java App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/overview) documentation.

To see all the available goals for the App Engine plugin, run

    mvn help:describe -Dplugin=appengine

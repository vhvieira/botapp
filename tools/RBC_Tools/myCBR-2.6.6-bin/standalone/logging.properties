# Properties file which configures the operation of the JDK
# logging facility.

# The system will look for this config file, first using
# a System property specified at startup:
#
# >java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=myLoggingConfigFilePath
#
# If this property is not specified, then the config file is
# retrieved from its default location at:
#
# JDK_HOME/jre/lib/logging.properties

# Global logging properties.
# ------------------------------------------
# The set of handlers to be loaded upon startup.
# Comma-separated list of class names.
# (? LogManager docs say no comma here, but JDK example has comma.)
handlers=java.util.logging.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global logging level.
# Loggers and Handlers may override this level
.level=INFO

# Loggers
# ------------------------------------------
# Loggers are usually attached to packages.
# Here, the level for each package is specified.
# The global level is used by default, so levels
# specified here simply act as an override.
de.dfki.level=FINE
de.dfki.cbrtool.level=FINEST

# Handlers
# -----------------------------------------

# --- ConsoleHandler ---
# Override of global logging level
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=WARNING
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

# --- FileHandler ---
# Override of global logging level
java.util.logging.FileHandler.level=WARNING
#java.util.logging.FileHandler.level=OFF

# Naming style for the output file:
# (The output file is placed in the directory
# defined by the "user.home" System property.)
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=./mycbr_%u_%g.log
#java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=cbrtool.log

# Limiting size of output file in bytes:
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit=5000000

# Number of output files to cycle through, by appending an
# integer to the base file name:
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count=1

# Style of output (Simple or XML):
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

There are two ways to use MyCBR:
you can use it as a plugin for Protege:
 * just copy the protege plugin directory into the plugins folder of protege. 
   This plugin directory (name is de.dfki.mycbr) is to be found under './distribution/protege_plugin'
   NOTE: Once you've started Protege you can enable this plugin under Project -> Configure...
   
and you can use it as a standalone application
 * just start the runnable jar file under './distribution/standalone/'
   In this case you should be aware that you cannot build up your model. You can only use it. (only retrieval right now)
   
So, to build up your model and load your casebase from a csv file, you have to use protege (http://protege.stanford.edu/)


Please report bugs, suggestions, etc. to:  bahls [at] dfki.uni-kl.de


Have fun,

  weight:
    description: |-
      Weight for instance group. Determines fraction of total workers in cluster
      that will be composed of instances from this instance group (e.g. if
      primary workers have weight 2 and secondary workers have weight 1, then
      the cluster should have approximately 2 primary workers to each secondary
      worker. Cluster may not reach these exact weights if constrained by
      min/max bounds or other autoscaling configurations.Default 1. Note that
      all groups have equal an equal weight by default, so the cluster will
      attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group within
      configured size bounds per group.
